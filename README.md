This repository contains a different project based on HTML, CSS, and Js, but please note that **`node_modules` is not included** to keep the repository clean. 
You will need to install the required dependencies separately.

## 📂 Project Setup

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### **2️⃣ Install Required Packages**
Since the `node_modules` folder is **not uploaded**, you must install the dependencies manually.  
To do this, run the following command inside the **server-side** folder:
```sh
npm install
```
This will install all required dependencies based on the `package.json` file.

### **3️⃣ Check Required Packages**
To know which **npm packages** are required, refer to the **server-side** `index.js` file.  
It includes all necessary `require()` statements that indicate which packages need to be installed.

## 🔥 Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## 🚀 Running the Project

### **For the Server**
```sh
cd server
node index.js
```

### **For the Client**
```sh
cd client
npm start
```

## 💡 Notes
- If you encounter missing module errors, install them manually:
  ```sh
  npm install package-name
  ```
- Make sure **MongoDB or MySQL is running** before starting the server.
- Feel free to **contribute**, **suggest improvements**, or **report issues**.
